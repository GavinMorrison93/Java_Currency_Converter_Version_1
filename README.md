# Java_Currency_Converter_Version_1

This is the first version of an early college project.

When it was complete, I went back to read the assignment specifications and realised I had written something that was not fit for purpose, so it was back to the drawing board.

This program does work however, and I always make sure I carefully follow the spec these days.
